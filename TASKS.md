# BUGS

TODO: 0 there's a big delay between when you edit a file and when it tells you
"re-running pipeline" this should be instantaneous
  * re-produce by saving main.js, waiting a few seconds, saving again, it won't
    log quickly

TODO: 0 when a job changes from 'running' to 'queued' it should have it's contents cleared

TODO: 0 find a new way to fix the large logging problem because throttling causes missed data
